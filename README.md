> This data hub, **COVID-EMDA** (**C**oronavirus **D**isease - **E**lectricity **M**arket **D**ata **A**ggregation), is orginally designed to track the potential impacts of COVID-19 on the electricity markets in the United States of America, and could also contribute to relevant interdisciplinary researches.

## Features
- Overall, this data hub contains the `coronavirus case`, `weather`, `generation mix`, `load` and `price data` for all the existing U.S. electricity marketplaces (CAISO, MISO, ISO-NE, NYISO, PJM, SPP , ERCOT) and some typical cities in these markets (San Francisco, Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Kansas City, Houston). 
- All the coronavirus case, weather and electricity market data are carefully verified and coordinated to match the geological scale.
- `Daily load profile`, `hourly generation mix` and `day-ahead price` are recorded and tidied in a consistent, compact and ready-to-use data format that makes it easy for cross-market analysis.
- Historical data dating back to 2017 are included as a time-series benchmark.

All the data source files are archived in folder `date_source/`, the cleaned and processed data are stored in folder `data_release`. The supporting team will provide daily updates to capture the latest sitation. All these files are properly collected by location. The file naming rule is: `MARKET_AREA_CATEGORY.csv`, e.g. `nyiso_nyc_load.csv`. This is a dataset of load profile in New York City, from 2017 to present.

Readers can turn to folder `startup/` for information about basic applications. For the need of extension, we provide the parser codes, which can be found in folder `parser/`.


## Data Source
This data hub contains three major sources: U.S. electricity market data, COVID-19 cases and weather data. For some categories, multiple data sources are carefully gathered to ensure accuracy.

- Electricity Market Data:\
[CAISO](http://oasis.caiso.com/mrioasis/logon.do), &nbsp; [MISO](https://www.misoenergy.org/markets-and-operations/real-time--market-data/market-reports/), &nbsp; [ISO-NE](https://www.iso-ne.com/markets-operations/iso-express), &nbsp; [NYISO](https://www.nyiso.com/energy-market-operational-data), &nbsp; [PJM](https://dataminer2.pjm.com/list), &nbsp; [SPP](https://marketplace.spp.org/groups/operational_data), &nbsp; [ERCOT](http://www.ercot.com/), &nbsp; [EIA](https://www.eia.gov/beta/electricity/gridmonitor/dashboard/electric_overview/US48/US48), &nbsp; [EnergyOnline](http://www.energyonline.com/).
